# Theoretical Tasks
Before doing any practical work, I've documented my theoretical assignments first. 
The things I've studied in theory after watching all the videos from Andrew, Chris, Margaret & Shala.

## How to gather functional and non-functional requirements

1. What should be the **scope** of the project means what features and functionalities are we covering in our first MVP
2. What should be the **cost** of our project so that we can measure our budgets and resources we utilize to create the project.
3. In what **time** frame we are creating the project or atleast our first MVP, because time would be the main constraint for stakeholders.

By Calculating all the above points we can measure the quality of our project that we can share with our stakeholders or clients.
